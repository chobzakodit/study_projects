### L2S4 Project for Algorithmes and Structures of Data!

### Purposes
It's a program that convert a plain text to a `binary search tree`, 
where every `node` represents a word in text with a frequency of appearance in this text
and lines where this word is retrieved.
### Usage
- launch `make` to compile
- execute `./main ./test.txt` to launch a program
- don't hesitate to change `test.txt` or use another text file for more tests
